## installation

The recommended way for developpers is to use the [doxel-dev docker container from the doxel-docker project](https://github.com/doxel/doxel-docker/blob/master/doxel-dev/README.md).

```

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libexpat1-dev mongodb

npm install -g strongloop bower grunt grunt-cli

npm install

lb-ng server/server.js client/app/scripts/lb-services.js

cd client

npm install

bower install

cd viewer

npm install

bower install

gulp

cd ..

grunt --force

```

## Run

For example:
```
slc start
slc ctl set-size doxel-loopback $(nproc)
slc ctl log-dump doxel-loopback --follow

```

## Debug

For example:

```
[PORT=12345] node --inspect -i -e "require('./server/server.js')"
```

The '-i' option will run the node interpreter in interactive mode, and using -e to load the entry point will ensure that you can effectively use the console and run interactive commands.

You can then access the app object from the terminal with eg:

```
> var loopback=require('loopback')
> var app=loopback.getModel('user').app
```
and optionally start the webserver with
```
> app.start(app.get('enableSSL');
```


The --inspect options allows attaching Chrome DevTools to nodejs using the URL printed in the console.

Or you can click on the "Open the dedicated DevTool for Node" link displayed on chrome://inspect#devices (You need a recent Chrome or Chromium version >= 58) to attach the DevTools automatically.
